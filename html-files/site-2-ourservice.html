    <p>My wife and I decided to start this company when it became clear this
         was our new permanent home. We have lived in this beautiful forest for almost
          twenty years now, and have been perfecting our coffee blend for most of that 
          time. About two years after our arrival, we found a beautiful plant with dark 
          seeds scattered around the base of it. The indigenous animals seemed to 
          enjoy this delectable treat, leaving only remnants of a few seeds behind. 
          This was the only thing we had found up until that point that wasn’t blue.
         Sarah has always loved coffee, and suggested we attempt to create our own.
          She has always been fascinated with the ways of the forest, and I love helping 
          her start a new project. At first, that’s all it was: a project. However, both 
          of us enjoyed it so much that we started growing our own plants, in a controlled 
          area protected from the reach of the curious creatures. With ever increasing 
          numbers of Humans starting to settle here, we have started to mass produce this 
          decadent beverage, as well as diversify our blends. Even some of our alien friends 
          enjoy a few of the versions. While nothing we have yet discovered on Blue even comes 
          close to matching the bitterness of Earth coffee, our locally grown blends are the 
          perfect start to any day.</p>

  <h2>Fresh Coffees</h2>
  <div class="about-para-cnt"><p>
  Freshly ground coffee tends to have a better
  onsistency and overall quality compared
  to pre-ground beans. This has to do, in part,
  with the moisture that's naturally present
  from oils in coffee beans. These oils,
  when dissolved in water, contribute 
  to a great-smelling and great-tasting
   cup of coffee.

  <h2>Good Services</h2>
  <div class="about-para-cnt"><p>
    We're really good at focusing on what customers need and require. 
    We have a real instinct to understand our customers. Good work! 
    We have the natural ability to understand and feel what our customers are
    experiencing, and we are able to meet their needs effectively.
   Great service, efficient communication and a really easy way to get a
   mortgage with lots of help and support to get the right deal.All
  responses were prompt and professional. Clearly, the upfront
  statement on our policy stated it was limited which told us
  that our preliminary research was not well thought out.

  <div class="about-para-cnt"><p>
    The team represents among the highest 
    levels of customer service.
    Information was accurate, responses to queries
    were turned around very fast. Answers were clear
  and where necessary detailed enough for us to 
  make informed decisions quickly, minimising the 
  end to end time to process complex transactions 
  among a number of parties.
